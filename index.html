                    About Me
                </h3>
                <p class="topic">
                    I'm a front-end developer who is passionate about Javascript, building great user experiences,
                    fighting for simplicity over complexity, constantly learning and someone who strives to mentor
                    and share with other developers around me (so, hopefully, they'll mentor and share with me).
                    I've worked for both large and small companies. Both on-site and remote.
                    And for the last handful of jobs have been a primary Team or Technical Lead.

                <p class="topic">
                    My interests primarily lie in design and implementation of native web apps, whether desktop or
                    mobile, single-page applications or otherwise. Although I primarily focus on Javascript (ES5/6,
                    node & browser), HTML/5 and CSS; I have plenty of experience writing PHP, Perl and other languages.
                    <br>
                    I've developed with a number of frameworks, such as AngularJS, FlightJS, ExtJS, JQuery along with
                    some ReactJS and its virtual-dom relatives. I enjoy learning new frameworks, libraries and
                    programming philosophies. I strive for simplicity, favor composition, strongly work towards a
                    reactive and functional style of development versus object-oriented and imperative

                <p class="topic">
                    Outside of learning about the web, I have a number of other interests as well (are you surprised?).
                    I dabble in playing guitar, chess and legos. I also occasionally fall back to my original love
                    focus in college which is art, drawing and painting (even digital painting in Photoshop). I also
                    enjoy hanging out with my best friend and wife, talking, watching our fav tv-shows and just
                    connecting.

                    BPSA
                    I am also the Chief Commissioner and Board President for the Baden Powell Service Association, an
                    inclusive, traditional scouting organization for youth and adults. I've been involved and on the
                    board since 2008.

                    American Sign Language
                    I have five, wonderful children, two of which are special needs. My youngest is partially deaf and
                    so we both speak and use American Sign Language with her. I've enjoyed learning sign so much, I
                    helped start and co-run an ASL meetup in my area and am constantly learning and finding ways to
                    interact and work with the Deaf community.

                    Don't ask me about Sublime or Atom. My IDE is vim. I've got a number of standard things setup,
                    which you can check out on my github page if you're interested. Outside of vim, my standard
                    workflow tools consist of git, Grunt/Gulp, npm, Browserify and Jasmine. Travis CI and SauceLabs are
                    amazingly helpful tools as well.
                    <br>
                    I use a Mac Book Pro and spend a lot of time in the Chrome dev tools debugger. I'm constantly
                    reading and learning web technologies and approaches; but the best way to learn is by doing and
                    repeating and then teaching - which is partly why I started this blog.
